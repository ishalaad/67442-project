# MyFridge - 67442-project

In the Github Repository we have demonstrated the use of the Google Cloud Vision API, adapting the repository from Google Cloud Vision website (https://cloud.google.com/vision/). After identifying the item that was chosen, we use a text file of foods and their expiration days, that was scraped and cleaned from the University of Nebraska Lincoln Food Storage website, to identify the expiration of the chosen item. 


## Quickstart
- Clone this repo and open FridgeApp.xcworkspace
- Build this application on an iPhone 8 for an ideal UI experience (will still work on an device.)

## There are 3 main pages in the application.
# Grocery List
- Can add items
- Can purchase items
- Can delete items

# Add Item
- Can add an item by manually adding
- Can add an item by choosing an item from the camera roll
- Can add an item by selecting items to quick add

# My Fridge
- Can see items that are going to expire soon
- Can delete items
